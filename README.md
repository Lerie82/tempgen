Not sure how we got this far with so many different web frameworks and still don't have some kind of generator. WordPress takes a lot of the automation for many people. However, it can be a pain in the ass for quick freelance projects to setup a new WordPress or cracnk out a WordPress template for a specific framework. This script will take user input and return basic template files. Why? Because it's easier for freelancing. Maybe there is already something like this out there and I just don't use it, see it, or probably didn't even look for it.
