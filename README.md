### Generate Web Layouts
Not sure how we got this far with so many different web frameworks and still don't have some kind of generator. WordPress takes a lot of the 
automation for many people. However, it can be a pain in the ass for quick freelance projects to setup a new WordPress or cracnk out a 
WordPress template for a specific framework. This script will take user input and return basic template files.
